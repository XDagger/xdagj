/**
 * Implementation from <a

 * implementation</a>
 *
 * <p>A SecureRandom implementation that is able to override the standard JVM provided
 * implementation, and which simply serves random numbers by reading /dev/urandom. That is, it
 * delegates to the kernel on UNIX systems and is unusable on other platforms. Attempts to manually
 * set the seed are ignored. There is no difference between seed bytes and non-seed bytes, they are
 * all from the same source.
