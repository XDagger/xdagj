**Problem Description**

[eg. The processing logic of existing miners is more cumbersome and can be handled in a more elegant way]
[eg. Line xx to line xx of the code in xx.java may have another thread crash vulnerability, which needs to be fixed as soon as possible]

**Suggestion(option)**
If you have a good modification method, you can explain it here, or submit a pull request.
